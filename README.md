# OVERVIEW

Spaceflash is a wave-based shooter playable with a VR headset (Oculus, HTC, etc.) where you destroy endless enemies coming to defend your moon base.

# GOALS

1. Creating a game that you can enjoy playing and has a minimum of bugs
2. Be able to achieve high scores and track them if you want
3. Using innovative VR features
4. Deploying the game

# SPECIFICATIONS

Using Oculus Quest Devkit and Unity, I want to create a shooter VR game that most players can have fun playing with. There&#39;ll be a scoreboard so players can see their high scores and compare them with other players. I also think about features such as moving around the playground and adding various weapon models depending on the duration of the project. At the end of the project, I want to deploy this VR game into the itch.io and Sidequest -a side platform for playing indie VR games- so the players can test with their own VR headset.
