# OVERVIEW

Spaceflash is a wave-based shooter playable with a VR headset (Oculus, HTC, etc.) where you destroy endless enemies coming to defend your moon base.

# GOALS

1. Creating a game that you can enjoy playing and has a minimum of bugs
2. Be able to achieve high scores and track them if you want
3. Using innovative VR features
4. Deploying the game

# SPECIFICATIONS

Using Oculus Quest Devkit and Unity, I want to create a shooter VR game that most players can have fun playing with. There&#39;ll be a scoreboard so players can see their high scores and compare them with other players. I also think about features such as moving around the playground and adding various weapon models depending on the duration of the project. At the end of the project, I want to deploy this VR game into the itch.io and Sidequest -a side platform for playing indie VR games- so the players can test with their own VR headset.


# MILESTONES

### Launch Pad

- Prepare the to-do list and create a backlog-based sprint planning
- Choose and be ready to use the required development environments, utilities and assets (Unity, GitHub, Oculus Devkit, etc.)

### Odyssey

- Preparation of all the elements to be used in the game like;
  - Creating the game level
  - Interacting with the game world (as animated VR hands)
  - Shooting with laser gun and destroying enemies
  - Creating a game manager and designing UI

### Cruise Phase

- Polish the game and add extra features if it&#39;s convenient
- DMC-free soundtracks!

### Landing

- Publish the game to itch.io and Sidequest and wait for the reviews!

## CONCLUSION

After a few months of development, I managed to upload my game to the platform called Sidequest. During this development process, I had the chance to try many new features related to Unity, such as the XR plugin, which is very frequently used for VR, and I also had the opportunity to experience a device such as VR, which has relatively few games.

Although I encountered many difficulties during the development process, I think that I completed the development in the time I wanted. I reached the idea of developing a playable and fun game, which is my main goal, and I added a lot of new experiences to myself during this process. Let me share with you a list of what I did and what I couldn't do in my game, where I tried to leave as few bugs as possible.

What could I do:
- Developing a game that I can publish (main goal)
- Publishing on Sidequest -an indie platform to install games-
- Using VR features like XR Rig
- Adding analytic services to analyze players’ behavior

What couldn’t I do:
- Adding online features like scoreboard
- More levels and weapons
- Customization
